# Sorting-Visualizer
A sorting visualizer is an application that allows users to interactively observe
and learn how different sorting algorithms work. Users can input an array of
elements, and the visualizer demonstrates how algorithms like bubble sort,
quick sort, or merge sort rearrange the items step by step to achieve a sorted
order, providing an educational tool for understanding the sorting process.
